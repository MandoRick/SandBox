Directions for chaning the default startup sketch in Arduino IDE 1 and 2

For Arduino IDE 1
Replace the file called BareMinimum.ino with the one provided 
located: (local drive):\Arduino\examples\01.Basics\BareMinimum\BareMinimum.ino



For Arduino IDE 2
When a new sketch is created, Arduino IDE populates it with the bare minimum empty setup and loop functions.
Some users may wish to adjust this code. That is now possible by specifying the path to a file containing the custom content in the advanced settings:

Press Ctrl + Shift + P keyboard shortcut (Command + Shift + P for macOS users)
 to open the "Command Palette".

Select the "Preferences: Open Settings (UI)" command from the menu
A "Preferences" tab will now open in the IDE
In the "Search Settings" field, type arduino.sketch.inoBlueprint
Add the path to the file containing your custom new sketch content in the field under the "Sketch: Ino Blueprint" setting
Click the X icon on the "Preferences" tab
Select File > Quit from the Arduino IDE menus
Start the Arduino IDE
